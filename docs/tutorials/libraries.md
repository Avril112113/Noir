# ðŸ“– Libraries

## What Are Libraries?

Libraries are simply tables containing helper methods. These methods can then be used throughout your addon.

## Libraries VS Services

The main distinction between libraries and services is that libraries do not need to listen for **game callbacks nor manage things**. They simply return values.

#### Services

Services on the other hand can, sure, return values via methods, but they also manage things relating to their purpose.

For example, the built-in Player Service listens for players joining and wraps the player in a class, and saves that class into the service. When the player leaves, the class is then removed from the service. The Player Service will also save information relating to the player to `g_savedata`. The service also comes with methods that allow you to retrieve saved players and such. The service is essentially **managing** players for your addon.

#### Libraries

With libraries, they only serve as helper functions that do similar things. As an example, think of Lua's built-in `math` library. They all take in values and return something that uses those values. (Libraries don't have to take in values!)

For example, the built-in Number library **purely** contains helper functions that deals with numbers.

## Built-In Libraries

Just like with services, Noir comes with built-in libraries. They can be found under `Noir.Libraries`.

A notable library is `Noir.Libraries.Events`.

### Events

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
local sayHello = Noir.Libraries.Events:Create()

sayHello:Connect(function(name)
    print("Hello, "..name)
end)

sayHello:Once(function(name) -- Only ever gets triggered once
    print("Hello and bye forever, "..name)
end)

for _ = 1, 5 do
    sayHello:Fire("Cuh4")
end

--[[
    terminal:
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello and bye forever, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
    "Hello, Cuh4"
]]

-- You can also disconnect a connection (function binded to an event) from an event
local connection = sayHello:Connect(function()
    -- Code
end)

connection:Disconnect()

-- Or even manually trigger the connection
connection:Fire()
```
{% endcode %}

## Creating A Library

Unlike services-ish, libraries are very simple to setup. Libraries are also fully intellisense supported and don't require any funky `---@class` definitions as the Lua VSCode extension can infer what is going on.

First, give your library a name. For this example, we'll call your library `Matrix`, and we'll have the library provide helper methods relating to SW matrices.

Define the library like so:

<pre class="language-lua" data-title="Matrix.lua" data-line-numbers><code class="lang-lua"><strong>MatrixLibrary = Noir.Libraries:Create("Matrix")
</strong></code></pre>

And simply add methods to it like so:

{% code title="Matrix.lua" lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
function MatrixLibrary:Offset(pos, x, y, z)
    pos[13] = pos[13] + x
    pos[14] = pos[14] + y
    pos[15] = pos[15] + z
    return pos
end

...
```
{% endcode %}

You can then use the libary methods like so:

{% code title="main.lua" lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
local myMatrix = matrix.translation(0, 1, 0)
print(myMatrix) -- 0, 1, 0

local new = MatrixLibrary:Offset(myMatrix, 0, 2, 0)
print(new) -- 0, 3, 0
print(myMatrix) -- 0, 3, 0
```
{% endcode %}

Uh oh! `myMatrix` also got changed from the `:Offset` method. We only want it to provide a new matrix to prevent issues. We could just use `matrix.translation`, but that would get rid of the rotational values. Instead, we can use a built-in library to copy the contents of `pos` (parameter of `:Offset()`) into a new table, and modify that new table instead. We can use a built-in library for this!

{% hint style="info" %}
Matrices in Stormworks are actually tables.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="Matrix.lua" lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
function MatrixLibrary:Offset(pos, x, y, z)
    local new = Noir.Libraries.Table:Copy(pos)
    new[13] = new[13] + x
    new[14] = new[14] + y
    new[15] = new[15] + z

    return new
end
```
{% endcode %}

Problem solved!

## Retrieving A Library

Libraries you create aren't stored in Noir. You have to store them yourselves by either placing them under `Noir.Libraries`, or just by placing them into `_ENV` like so:

```lua
MatrixLibrary = ... -- placed into _ENV
Noir.Libraries.MatrixLibrary = ... -- placed into Noir.Libraries
```

{% hint style="info" %}
\_ENV is a table containing globals.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
function hello()
    return "hello world"
end

_ENV["hello"]() -- "hello world"
_ENV.hello() -- "hello world"
hello() -- "hello world"

x = 0
_ENV["x"] -- 0
_ENV.x -- 0
```
{% endcode %}
{% endhint %}
